### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is âœ¨ Natalie Kerr âœ¨. I am a data scientist at NC Electric Cooperatives and former quantitative ecologist, who specializes in various applications of statistics and modeling in the energy sector, field of ecology, and beyond!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various projects relating to time series forecasting.
- ðŸ’¡ My research involves quantifying inclusive fitness of alternative living strategies in a cooperatively breeding bird, detecting evidence of local adaptation of an at-risk carnivorous plant to current and future stressors, as well as limitations and strengths of model selection approaches when dealing with climate drivers of vital rates and subsequent impacts on structured population models.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about various applications and pipelines of machine learning techniques (MLOps, MLflow).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data science projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything statistics-related (or about my cat, Lola!)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: nataliezoekerr@gmail.com
