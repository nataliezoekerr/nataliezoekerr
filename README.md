### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Natalie Kerr âœ¨ (she/her) âœ¨. I am a quantitative biologist and data scientist at [Duke University](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/natalie.kerr) who specializes in various applications of statistics and demographic modeling in the field of ecology (and beyond!).

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various projects relating to alternative living strategies in a cooperatively breeding bird, detecting evidence of local adaptation of a at-risk carnivorous plant to recent stressors, as well as limitations and strengths of model selection approaches when dealing with climate drivers.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about various applications of tree-based methods and machine learning techniques.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything data.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything statistics-related or my cat, Lola!
