### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is âœ¨ Natalie Kerr âœ¨. I am a quantitative biologist and data scientist at [Duke University](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/natalie.kerr) who specializes in various applications of statistics and demographic modeling in the field of ecology (and beyond!).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various projects relating to alternative living strategies in a cooperatively breeding bird, detecting evidence of local adaptation of an at-risk carnivorous plant to current and future stressors, as well as limitations and strengths of model selection approaches when dealing with climate drivers of vital rates and subsequent impacts on structured population models.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about various applications of tree-based methods and machine learning techniques.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data science projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything statistics-related (or about my cat, Lola!)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: nataliezoekerr@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to dance.
