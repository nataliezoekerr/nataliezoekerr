### Hi there! 👋 

<!--
My name is Natalie Kerr ✨ (she/her) ✨. I am a quantitative biologist and data scientist who specializes in various applications of statistics and demographic modeling in the field of ecology (and beyond!).

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on various projects relating to alternative living strategies in a cooperatively breeding bird, detecting evidence of local adaptation of a at-risk carnivorous plant to recent stressors, as well as limitations and strengths of model selection approaches when dealing with climate drivers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about various applications of tree-based methods and machine learning techniques.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything data.
- 💬 Ask me about anything statistics-related or my cat, Lola!
- 📫 How to reach me: nataliezoekerr@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to dance.
